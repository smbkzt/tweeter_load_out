I agree. However ivanka's  husband has issues with Christie.  I agree with you üëç. https://t.co/AOhqW1rcPF ‚á§‚á• @phyllis_lavoy I think whatever differences they have had better get resolved. I truly hope that Chris will be chosen and I think most of Trump supporters will agree. Gowdy is leaving soon &amp; Rudy doesn't have the Fortitude anymore. Chris wants a shot especially at the Clinton's.

if you did everything that you could. you fought. you sacrificed. you gave your blood, sweat &amp; tears for a relationship &amp; it still didn‚Äôt work out. that‚Äôs not on you, it just wasnt meant to be and that‚Äôs all the closure you really need.full video @ https://t.co/HgDuHv8tKb https://t.co/8YJxyQTNPI ‚á§‚á• @spicebae_ I feel like I give my all to people who never deserved it. But somehow, I still find away to blame myself for everything going so wrong. And that sucks.
Couples getting revealed one after anotherYeah, Dispatch, when will you reveal one for EXO? It's about time they date, it's not like they're getting any younger...........#iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #EXOL @weareoneEXO https://t.co/1cvxcynXMz ‚á§‚á• @DOwithlovexoxo @weareoneEXO As much as I would love them to date, and I really hope they are dating in secret right now, I don't want dispatch to be the one to reveal them. I want them to announce their relationships by themselves, hopefully when they are getting married.

Father of Parkland victim slams NRA videos:"If this was put out by a terrorist organization, we would be raising the terror threat level in this country. Why are we letting this lobby have anything to do with DC? I don't understand it!" https://t.co/voYy9BhnvV https://t.co/6fXW7qxVJx ‚á§‚á• @ABCPolitics @SarahKSilverman I sah this Video on Facebook, enough to feel sick. I agree, it sound Deana is also unglued   She should go back too do Infomercial-at least no one is watching ü§¨
Whenever I feel sorry for Melania, I just watch this video of her enthusiastically supporting the birther lie: https://t.co/onmfpVzyv8 https://t.co/etV3psnoo1 ‚á§‚á• @goldengateblond Wow, I've never seen that vid. What a cold-stone, horrible bitch. You're right, feeling any sort of empathy toward her just flew right out the window. She deserves Donald Trump.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders truly is the perfect defender of absolute garbage and that‚Äôs an insult to garbage. She‚Äôd defend murder and make it seem like the victim wanted to die. A gross sycophant and a lying fool. ‚á§‚á• @TheRickyDavila Let's make bets on how many times she starts a sentence with the word "LOOK!" when "answering" reporter's questions. It's disrespectful, dismissive and she lies right after she says it.
He‚Äôs also wrong about the nature of America and immigration. The latest from @alexwitoslawski https://t.co/Y5I4jsVvPP ‚á§‚á• @JMcfeels @alexwitoslawski Ben is very intelligent. Usually when he's wrong it's because he's lying. And when he's lying it's almost always about Israel.
Losing my mind not training nor being on the ice. It's been seven months since this has stuff started and even grocery shopping pushes me to my limits. #FigureSkating seems as far as the top of Everest at this point. ‚á§‚á• @TheTigerOliver You can do it Tiger! I know it seems hard right now and words can only do so much but keep pushing through! I have all the faith in you üòÄ
I‚Äôve gone from ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be an ass to umps, they are just humans‚Äù to ‚Äújeez, these guys are power hungry, mall cop pricks‚Äù in short order.  Wow.  Talk about not in it for the kids. ‚á§‚á• @MichaelBerrySho Good umpires are like good political officials. When they do their job right, you rarely know their names or faces but everything just seems to run smooth and makes sense. When they are terrible, though...

Anderson:"Tennis is a process, I got things going last year in Paris, now I can put myself in the position of winning. My best game is just as good as Federer's or Nadal's, they just can play it more often than I do, but I feel I'm getting better at it" #BNPPO18 https://t.co/SghPOuDN8L ‚á§‚á• @Ubitennis Interesting....putting urself next to the sport‚Äôs greatest, now that is indeed confidence. He is indeed right if u also count the practice sessions as playing ur best tennis ever. He speaks his mind, good for him
I‚Äôm on a boat and I‚Äôm tan. 2 things not common for me. https://t.co/8379RCcb7W ‚á§‚á• @elilieb I wish I could be on a boat and be tan right now. Instead I am sitting in an office, do boring work and outside it's dark, wet and cold. And foggy. Can't forget the fog. üò´
And you consistently bitch about it. SO WHAT https://t.co/rq3pn8vgfH ‚á§‚á• @HoopsNBrews I personally believe that you guys understand that heat/ negative interaction is the best way to draw attention for your podcast on this app and you‚Äôre capitalizing on that by constantly making outlandish Basketball Opinions. I honestly respect it not gonna lie.
Big win to start the road trip! Another dominant performance from @KingJames! Debate where he's going next year all you want or worry about what will happen in the Finals but for now I'll just enjoy watching greatness in a Cleveland uniform all I can! ‚á§‚á• @GVartwork @KingJames I cannot believe we have two players starting for the Cleveland Cavaliers from the 330. That is a dream for our fans...two of our own leading the charge.
I know its hard when you used to be a certain weight &amp; can‚Äôt fit into any of your old clothes, but its okay to not be the same weight you were in highschool. Our body‚Äôs change. We get hips &amp; curves &amp; we are still beautiful. ‚á§‚á• @chantelschnider You're absolutely right girl!! After having 2 daughters my body is no where near my pre-birth weight but I'm totally fine with that!! I'm a little  #BoldAndBeautiful
