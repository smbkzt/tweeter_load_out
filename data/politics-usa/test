Well Jon hasn't responded at all since Monday night so I'm gonna give him space and if he wants to talk eventually he will, plain and simple. I'm not feeling hopeful about it, but it is what it is and I'm feeling more stable knowing I'll see an affordable therapist soon. ‚á§‚á• I'm just still shocked that I apparently had so much unresolved stuff right under the surface. I wasn't that close to my brother but honestly I think his death triggered some sort of abandonment thing and trauma bc it's the main disruption recently.
How does Justin Trudeau's continued description of Science Minister Kirsty Duncan as a ‚ÄúNobel Prize-winning scientist‚Äù (she technically isn't) make you feel about Trudeau's trustworthiness?

Gonna have to disagree with Framebro on this one. A black ethnostate could work out very well for all concerned if it had Black America's best people in charge, rather than a bunch of communist thugs like Zimbabwe did. https://t.co/d3Uuf5BnJA ‚á§‚á• @BeigeShiba Massive 'if,' but agreed. The big problem is that until the damage done by LBJ's Great Society &amp; the Frankfurt School is undone, Black American leadership will look like Zimbabwe's.

Yo some people are straight up evil. There are people out here so unhappy and cruel that they go out of their way to bully people. If you don't like someone, either tell them or let them live their life. Don't go around hurting people. That's disgusting. ‚á§‚á• Some things people do have made my jaw drop: Photoshopping pictures of people they call their friends or giving advice they know isn't right. This type of bullying where you pretend to be buddy buddy with people is more evil than telling people off.

Heard tonight that @jerryspringer flies to Northern Kentucky to rant in a folk coffee shop on a podcast called liberals always win.  For some reason he still thinks he‚Äôs a Mayor.

The Mexican side of my family is not white. The rest/majority of my family are white people of European origin. Am I white or white-passing? I'm unsure about how these things break down, and I've been too afraid to ask. ‚á§‚á• @MarkOStack I struggle with this same thing. My dad is from Jordan/Palestine, but I look white. I feel it's passing, since I have some physical features of the region, just not the skin. And it feels wrong to say I'm not Middle Eastern, since I was raised in the culture and know it.
I've said this before but I think Sessions has been so quiet because he's working on a bombshell case that could get him killed if it was discovered before indictments were made. Torpedoes at the swamp. That is my strong hunch. I used to think he was a slug but pieces don't fit. ‚á§‚á• @ChuckNASCAR I believe swampers have got something on him - possibly audio of racially-charged comments from the past. Just guessing - don't know if that'd be enough - could literally be anything.

End of Magic-Lakers felt like a shady AAU finish: Magic down 1 inbound w/.6 left, clock mistakenly starts before ball is touched; after review clock re-set and play resumes w/jump ball at center court.

The Lakers already defended the inbounds play once, and if it weren't for the mistimed button push, would have won right there.  So it doesn't really change anything.

Will the Victoria Memorial be demolished if a "nationalist" government comes to power in Bengal? ü§î Queen Victoria: satyanaash! Firangi rani! Shock horror ‚á§‚á• @sagarikaghose It should have all traces of that evil bitch removed. And turned into a refuge for the poor. Nothing to do with right wing. Everything to do with morality. All statues of evil people the same treatment.
"I believe that just like the civil rights movement, it was the young people who said we've had enough...I believe that we're on the verge of something really, really big" says @Oprah on Parkland students https://t.co/jBMco5JSva ‚á§‚á• @RyanKadro @Oprah This is the same Oprah that wants all old white people to die, right??  Did she notice the kids on the news are white???  Just an observation. What a hypocrite.

This is not limited to Employees and Intrapreneurs, to bring a change #BusinessLeaders &amp; #Entrepreneurs have to b prepared first.
New Order ‚ÄúTemptation‚Äù poll ‚á§‚á• @MarkRichardson Can't believe the Substance version is so far up front. It may be the first time many people heard Temptation so it is the version many love but I always thought it was terrible compared to the original. Genuinely shocked when I first heard it.
3 injured in Huffman High School shooting; 1 student dead.Wait, a semi-automatic wasn‚Äôt used. A ban on such firearms wouldn‚Äôt have helped.And the ‚Äúgun-free zone‚Äù sign didn‚Äôt work. Astonishing.Single point of entry and metal detectors may have worked. Secure the schools. ‚á§‚á• @unscriptedmike You know I‚Äôm tired of liberals saying gun laws need to be enforced. It‚Äôs bullshit teach your kids the right way and it wouldn‚Äôt happen. Also it‚Äôs very ironic that inner city schools are having the most problems...
The Trump administration has once again attacked California to score political points. California shouldn‚Äôt be punished for shielding law-abiding immigrants from deportation. California will stand strong! ‚á§‚á• @SenFeinstein The majority of Californians and Americans agree with you Senator Feinstein.  Please ignore the Trolls who reply en masse to your messages.  They get an alert the minute you send out a tweet.  They are a fringe minority.Please continue fighting the good fight.
My 7 year old daughter's crying in bed right now because she wants to wear her Star Wars t-shirt to school but is scared her classmates will laugh because she likes 'boy stuff'. I'm so sad/angry for her. Please RT and comment so I can show her how awesome girl #StarWars fans are. ‚á§‚á• @NJSimmondsTPK Star Wars is definitely cool!! Remember Princess Leia is one tough chick. She never put up with any boy's crud. She was happy and proud to be herself. Girl, you will rock it! Never worry what others think. Believe in YOU!!!!
@suunto is there likely to be an update to set up Pool triathlon mode &amp; duathlon sport mode for the Spartan? The Ambit 3 now seems to be superior. ‚á§‚á• @hopkins_joanne Hi, Spartan has multi-sports option. Ex. Start running &gt; press and hold upper  button to switch to the next sport mode. Since there are a lot of sport modes, turn off other sport mode and turn on those sport mode that you need. So that when you switch, you can see it right away
Tucker Carlson Plans 'Men in America' Series for Women's History Month https://t.co/R6hNVUrgEc ‚á§‚á• @johniadarola What a dick. How do these right wingers not realize that easily 90% of history we're taught is about men? What kind of snowflake cuck would feel that men aren't given recognition???
I just realized why Daydream &amp; Airplane were the two songs with MVs. Daydream talks about a part of him 'daydreaming' what a carefree life he'd have if he was a normal person. While Airplane literally talks about his reality as a successful artist who finally reached his dreams. https://t.co/aKSLIq66wy ‚á§‚á• A part of him longs for a normal life. But another part of him truly loves where he is in his life is right now. These are his thoughts. This is j-hope.I FEEL EMO#iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY
What are your favorite mythological creatures? Feel free to include DnD monsters and fantasy creatures too, just don't forget to include their preferred habitat. If I have enough time, I want to draw them and insert them into the Zine I have to make for class. ‚á§‚á• @Nova_Fae Sphinxes are my favorite. They give riddles, eat those that are wrong, and generally love in deserts.I have a lot of favorites though
No @DLoesch we can‚Äôt accept women who put guns before the lives of our children. I would say God bless to you too except that I know He isn‚Äôt blessing you. https://t.co/10HaFxIJV2 ‚á§‚á• @Marina_Sirtis @DLoesch A) you're an actress you play make-believe for a living you just don't seem to have any intellectual capability.B) you seem to think you speak for God you might want to find psychiatric help for that oneC) has one great author said shut up an act that's all you're good at
I need some help. What are y‚Äôall afraid of like extreme fears.

What is Alex‚Äôs plan for those 55,000 jobs? I get entirely the outrage, and think much of it is justified, but what are those 55,000 families supposed to do if those jobs go? Having principles is much easier when you don‚Äôt have to face any real consequences for them. https://t.co/hm2RV88siW ‚á§‚á• @MattBurton_law I rarely disagree with you Matt, but here I do. Some principles are worth more than jobs. If the s principle matters enough to us, which it should, we should invest in alternative industry that doesn‚Äôt profit from illegal war.
We are Californians.  Trump lost here by 4,000,000 votes.We protect our environment.We protect immigrants.We believe in equal opportunity.I‚Äôve never been prouder to be a Californian. ‚á§‚á• @MikeLevinCA @Corvid1031 And for the record... The rest of America voted Trump in to bash your political (criminal) hogwash (shit) right out of town and out of Our Country. Way to go America.
Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell thought it would be a good idea to go after NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch on Twitter. https://t.co/SS8jmylFp4 ‚á§‚á• @SarahPalinUSA Jebus!!! Rosie is one of the ugliest women I've ever seen... both inside and out. I've served, my father has served, my brother, my grandfather... for this pig to have the freedom to be an obnoxious cow? Our right to bear arms will never be taken away. Get a clue Rosie.#MAGA

Oh wait, drugs are already banned right? How come they kill 3xs as many people per year as firearms?
Why does Philippine media portray Bisayas in an image where they speak hard Filipino or one who is uneduucated? This toxic portrayal feeds the culture of Manila imperialism. BISAYAS DON'T ACT LIKE THIS. SOME OF US ARE ALSO EDUCATED AND SPEAK FILIPINO FLUENTLY. HINDI KAMI BOBO. ‚á§‚á• @crisdaviss DAMN RIGHT! Let's call right portrayal and representation on our own media, if not let's answer a lower ratings and imminent death to them kung ayaw nila magimprove

Have you noticed that people who have impacted your life the most or been closest/most attractive to you (like on an energetic level) have the same north/true node? ‚á§‚á• @happycapricorn i'm not sure historically because i lack the charts but the two people closest to me right now both have libra north nodes. i have a sagittarius north node.

Can sense Mugabe wants these guys to go for him.He is spoiling for a fight.All these  acts seem well choreographed and well rehearsed.That old man will spoil the party for ED if they don't treat him with cautiin ‚á§‚á• @RMajongwe ED is already wrong footed . By showing he is unhappy with Bob and sending unveiled threats he has already played into the trap. Mugabe is delusional but cunning too. He says his people are in rural Zimbabwe ( Zanu pf base) and ED used Harare people MDC base to chuck him out
Of President Buhari And King David by @Olusegunverdict https://t.co/uMhIqYMiaA https://t.co/7cOq0UOyj7 ‚á§‚á• @wisesani @Olusegunverdict I read "President Muhammadu Buhari &amp; the descendants of Shimei" by Adesina it never made any meaning but"Of President Buhari &amp; King David" The Verdict by Adeniyi has given it meaning.Its now 2 sides of the same coin. As u said Buhari, 2 his supporters,is a god who can do no wrong
I keep my Facebook very closed and safe so that I can go there to relax when Twitter is too much. Even so, today I managed to stumble across a load of transphobic bile.

@DLoesch it‚Äôs unproductive, disingenuous &amp; non resourceful to claim that you‚Äôre anything but a WHORE for the @NRA $$$ Check yo‚Äôself, little girl. The 2nd Amendment doesn‚Äôt protect your ignorant foolishness. That would be the 1st Amendment. #fool #LIAR #DumbThingsSmartGirlsDo https://t.co/VkXHDAoXND ‚á§‚á• @dardixon1 @DLoesch @NRA The "Second Amendment" designates the right to bear arms to a well regulated militia, people who are trained to handle a musket style shotgun, not an AR-15. Is that black hair natural, or do you color it to impress your boss?
