Fuk https://t.co/2n9HINDQCv ‚á§‚á• @SirLarr Explanation: In Margaritaville there is no "swanky," only "swaky" because they don't believe in the harsh "nk" sounds. Tequila is much more chill.
Powerful words. An Important message. I am so glad that this is your feminism! We are all better for it. #MyFeminism https://t.co/fQ4LXyafAd ‚á§‚á• @MaryamMonsef "Born in Afghanistan?""I believe I was."Translation:"I know damn well I wasn't, but this is my chickenshit way of saying otherwise without fully committing to the lie."Woman, irrelevant.Immigrant, irrelevant.We want you gone because you're a liar.See the difference?
This Friday. Our 100th Episode. It‚Äôs really a THANK YOU to everyone who has stuck by us! This one‚Äôs for you... and TRUUUUUUST me you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Except for that one thing that happens, that bit sucks but the rest?! ‚ú®ü§Øüí•‚Ä¢@agentsofshield #shield100 @mingna_wen https://t.co/qxf88H7MQy ‚á§‚á• @Lil_Henstridge @AgentsofSHIELD @MingNa_Wen that one thing? If you mean someone who hates SHIELD, I agree, but I'm worried it's that other thing the others truly won't like...and I don't mean the Kree. They'll probably show up around Tax Day.
What don't you understand about WE BLAME NRA LOBBYISTS LIKE YOU? A Republican pollster found that 74% of @NRA members (ps - only 1 in 10 gun owners even belong) support stronger gun laws. This is not about NRA members - it's about your radicalized, deadly agenda. Stop projecting. https://t.co/LI49MX2Cob ‚á§‚á• @shannonrwatts @RobAbramowitz @NRA The @NRA is the largest dues paying civic/issue organization in the history of the planet. We will happily defend your right to hate us.  You're welcome.
After threatening calls and emails, Utah lawmaker drops controversial Trump highway bill.https://t.co/QcGwWkIVX7 ‚á§‚á• @KUTV2News Wow stop President Trump name for highway over threats sounds like there afraid to do right thing. And and PD catch this person or persons! Sad. @FoxNews sounds like a snowflake whinny
Please learn about government - things like paper are budgeted by your local school board, not by the state.  If you don't like how the local school board is doing something, then complain TO THEM or replace them. https://t.co/1gknlo4Bdo ‚á§‚á• @GayConservativ3 And I find it difficult to believe that the school ran out of paper for a week due to budgetary reasons. Maybe because of a failure to place an order? At around $20 (retail) for a CASE of copier paper I suspect the petty cash box in the principal's office could have handled it.
Nomination forms getting turned in! #MAGA DONATE https://t.co/1Gb6cZyKab https://t.co/YZmL4uUcEA ‚á§‚á• @RealErinCruz @StaliansJerry So touching someones ass gets people FIRED IMEDIATLY for harassment!BUT FBI IGNORING OUR LAWS THAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE BROWARD SCHOOL SHOOTER WHO KIILLED 17 KIDs IS OK=NO ONE LOSSES JOB IMMEDIATLY?=NO ONE GOES TO PRISON for MURDER?WAKE UP AMERICAN VALUES R WRONG!
It's about money &amp; power Erin. Kevin knows that. Truth is they don't even care about their illegal votes. The more bodies you have, the more federal &amp; state funding you get. As well as more Representatives to match the growing population. Money &amp; power. Nothing new under the sun. https://t.co/EFDxto1Utz ‚á§‚á• @starcrosswolf @wraithvenge Sounds like you men have it right!  Sad state of affairs in CA.  I hope our great President takes a ton of National Guard and US Marshals with him when he visits CA.  Several Police departments in CA are famous now for Standing Down and letting rioters hurt conservatives.
I‚Äôm not sure about the rules, but somehow there is a jump ball at center court now and Frank Vogel (rightfully so) is going crazy ‚á§‚á• @LakersNation It was the right call. The Lakers had possession of the bad pass. To give it back to Orlando would've been unfair to Lakes defense
Beating a child lightly... sorry, what does this mean? Is force applied? Does it physically hurt? The problem here is you assume bc I didn‚Äôt speak on emotional abuse, which can result from physical abuse, but can exist independently of, I think the one is worse than the other https://t.co/GkHA7Shrmq ‚á§‚á• @ShadowsOfWolf_ Yes. Force application does not equal physical abuse. You are right. Emotional abuse can come from the trauma of physical abuse. It can also come from the trauma of having your favourite things taken away or being pushed into isolation. And sometimes can be worse in those cases.
LITERALLY THE STUPIDEST SHIT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ICB https://t.co/VPUptn1wzi ‚á§‚á• @tobias_wrong Don't even get me started on this lol. Like I'm looking at both sides and sometimes the way jae says things come off wrong but omg chill out please
I feel ashamed of artists who BUY followers on social media.Been in many meetings where companies got lied to by artists saying they have ALL these followers to market their product.Its seems illegal and I wish twitter would block the lies. Honesty to your fans is key.#FakeArtist ‚á§‚á• @NikkiSixx If you believe in honesty then why do you promote fake propaganda stories? The things you say are hilarious, as all the things you bitch about you do yourself. üê∫üêë
Rappler insists it pays taxes accurately, promptly, and diligently."This is clear intimidation and harassment. The government is wasting its energy and resources in an attempt to silence reporting that do not please the administration," @mariaressa says https://t.co/Gjs6rvA65e ‚á§‚á• @cnnphilippines @mariaressa We're not talking about #PressFreedom here. It's about tax evasion. If you believe you're paying properly then nothing to worry. Why do you have to insert attack on press freedom everytime? #VictimCard @rapplerdotcom
Suns fans - Where would you rank Devin Booker on the list of best NBA players under 25 years old? ‚á§‚á• @Bickley_Marotta Anyone who puts booker ahead of giannis right now should never be allowed to vote in anything ever again. Part of it depends what kind of game you want. If you want scoring he‚Äôs higher if you need everything but scoring box you have scorers then Simmons may pass him
its not 1 person fault pls stop blaming coach or 1 player in the team but if it makes you happy then do it to me ‚á§‚á• @MickiePP I'm actually really mad hearing this right now. You win some, you lose some. That's part of the game. I appreciate that you want to take the blame instead. But Don't. You all fought well, but you especially do not deserve to take the unnecessary heat.
I think I am going to tell him how I feel before he leaves ‚á§‚á• I‚Äôve never confess to a guy that I like him unless he told me first or I just knew the feelings were mutual. But hey there‚Äôs a first for everything, right?
.@Rosie, @DanMalloyCT, @GovMalloyOffice: Do you consider rape survivor, #2A advocate and #NRA member Kimberly Corban a terrorist? Is @Kimberly_Corban a member of a terrorist organization? #NeverAgain https://t.co/5evMztbF1B ‚á§‚á• @NRATV @Rosie @DanMalloyCT @GovMalloyOffice @Kimberly_Corban The #LiberalLogic and mental gymnastics displayed by the libtards in the comments is astounding. She isn't a terrorist but she is a member of a terrorist organization. This let's them pat themselves on their collective backs right after calling a rape survivor a terrorist.
All the @dele_official haters will forget to mention he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdive‚Äù when he got aggressively kicked giving the ball back. If he had‚Äôve ‚Äúdived‚Äù Juve would‚Äôve been down to 10 men at 1-0 down. ‚á§‚á• @thisisiss @dele_official You could be right. But he has made his own bed and lets be truthful, he has done more dives than Tom Daley üòÇ It would have been great to have 4-5 English teams in the quarters
